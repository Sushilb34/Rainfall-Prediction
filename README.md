#Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using historical weather data and machine learning techniques. Accurate rainfall prediction is important for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
The model analyzes meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind conditions to predict rainfall outcomes.

Objectives:
Analyze historical weather data

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

Train machine learning models for rainfall prediction

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Visualize insights and predictions

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from **Kaggle**.  
You can explore similar rainfall and weather datasets on Kaggle for reference and reproducibility.
